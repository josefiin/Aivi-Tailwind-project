Student Project November 2024

The purpose of this assignment was to create a website of 4â€“6 pages using a CSS framework. By testing the framework's features and customization options, we have learned how to manage components, layout, and design without the need to write custom CSS.

Note: The design is inspired by other websites, the focus for this assignment was the understanding and use of Tailwind CSS.
